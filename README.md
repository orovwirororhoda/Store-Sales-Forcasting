# Store-Sales-Forcasting
A sales analytics using regression model

Project Option 3: Store Sales Forecasting (Time Series)
Objective: Time Series Forecasting

Description: Forecast store sales by product family (one level of hierarchy). You can forecast sales for different product families separately, or aggregate to overall sales. This allows for manageable complexity while still working with real retail data.

Key Tasks:

Load and explore the store sales data
Aggregate sales by product family (one level of hierarchy) or use overall sales
Create time series at daily/weekly level
Forecast 1-month ahead (30 days) sales using ARIMA, ETS, Prophet models
Handle seasonalities (weekly, monthly, yearly patterns)
Compare different forecasting models using MAE, RMSE, MAPE
Provide forecast visualizations and confidence intervals
Note: You can forecast by product family (e.g., GROCERY I, BEVERAGES, etc.) or aggregate to total sales - choose one approach
Forecast Horizon: 1 month (30 days) ahead
